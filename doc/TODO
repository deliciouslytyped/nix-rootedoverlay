Major todo:
  1) deal with the todos in rooted.nix
  2) write the rest of the lib tests
  3) make some usable documentation
  4) release 1.0 \o/

document and or do something about selectors using colliding packages from the wrong scope (with example)

using the layers approach for the test framework probably doesnt make sense because its already reliant on .extend working (?)
^no, shouldnt be a problem  - this is what the bootstrap is for?

rename from rooted to something more appropriately descriptive?

consider the enabledebugging infrastructure

conventions:
  minimize the use of nonoverridable let expressions

document error: attribute 'override' missing, at /bakery2/oven1/personal/projects/nixapps/nix-rootedoverlay/overlay.nix:56:43 as a possible result of not usind stdenv for a base package
  or at least do something about opaque foot shooting?

document that some lib functions expect certain conventions, such as autoimportAutopackages wanting 4_packages (or redesign this)
